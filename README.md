## Project Overview

**Virtual Garden** is a web application designed to assist plant enthusiasts and gardeners in taking care and managing their plant collections. The app uses advanced AI technologies to analyze photos of plants, accurately identify species, assess plant health, and provide personalized care recommendations based on the current status of the plant. It also integrates real-time weather data to optimize care advice even more based on local conditions.

- **Identify Plant Species:** Use AI-powered recognition to identify plant species from images.
- **Health Assessment:** Detect early signs of diseases, pests, or nutrient deficiencies in plants.
- **Personalized Care Recommendations:** Get tailored advice on how to care for the plant based on its species and health condition.
- **Weather Integration:** Incorporate real-time and forecasted weather data to adjust care routines according to temperature, humidity, and upcoming weather events.

### APIs Integrated:

- **Google Gemini API:** Used for plant species identification, health assessment, and care recommendations.
- **OpenWeatherMap API:** Provides real-time weather data and short-term weather forecasts for climate-based care adjustments.
- **plant.id API (Backup):** A backup option for species identification, health diagnostics, and an AI chatbot for instant plant care advice.
- **Visual Crossing API (Backup):** Offers hyper-local weather data and alerts for extreme weather, such as frost or storms.

### Front End:

- **React**: Chosen for its flexibility and industry standard status, with a large ecosystem of libraries for ease of development.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Used for its customizability and ease of use in styling the web interface.
